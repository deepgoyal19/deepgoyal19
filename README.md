I am an enthusiastic pre-final year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology. I will be completing my junior year in May 2023. 

I have a strong interest in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, deep learning and computer graphics. 

I recently submitted two research works. One of them focuses on using machine learning to automate the extraction of corners, edges, and surfaces from high-resolution point cloud data. The second work is on emotion recognition using multimodal features from HOG and LBP. Additionally, I presented my research on Sustainable Traffic Management Systems for Smart Cities at an international conference.
